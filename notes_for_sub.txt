  How did you choose your architecture
  
  Why did you choose your design pattern
  
  Why ddi you choose client server model
  
  Why the  protocol to communicate?
  
  Why did you do it like that -> they want to know your shikul daat
  
  Why this data structure 
  
  Why this technology
  
  How does http work? -> what is http Request, Header, Body.
  
  I need to learn how does the node server's communication work's how it servers the react JSX and "compiles" it to the data (HTML / CSS / VANILLA  JS)
